## About <a name = "about"></a>

Our rover uses 6 wheeled rocker bogie suspension system along with a 5 DOF custom arm. The onboard computing is handled by an Nvidia Jetson Xavier coupled with a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller to assist with IO. The rover is equipped with an Intel Realsense depth camera, 3 Cameras, and GPS.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

- [ ] Ubuntu LTS 22.04

### Installing

Clone the repository into your workspace.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/roboticsatiowa/Base-Station.git
chmod u+x ./Base-Station/install.sh
./Base-Station/install.sh
```

### Running the code

Option 1 (Recommended): Run the launch file using the launch script. This will automatically launch the rover.
```bash
source launch.sh
```
Option 2: Run the launch file directly.
```bash
ros2 launch base_station base_station.launch.py
```
Note: rover will need to be launched separately.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Moveit2 inverse kinematics
- [ ] Moveit2 motion planning
- [ ] Foxglove custom control/gui options
- [ ] ROS Bag recording
